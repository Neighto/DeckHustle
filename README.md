# How to Play
Simply use WASD or arrow keys to move your pirate across the ship's deck. Win by bringing cannonballs from the box to the cannon enough times to destroy the enemy ship while dodging the enemy projectiles. Normal mode is pretty tough, but if you're looking for a real challenge, test your might in Legendary mode!
